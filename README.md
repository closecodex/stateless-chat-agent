# Stateless Chat Graph with Time Tool

A minimal LangGraph agent that replies to each user input.  
If the user asks “What time is it?”, it calls a tool that returns the current UTC time in ISO‑8601 format.

## Quickstart

1. **Clone the repository and enter the directory:**

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:closecodex/Stateless-chat-graph-.git
    cd Stateless-chat-graph-
    ```

2. **Set up the virtual environment and install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **(If using Ollama) Download the Llama 3 model:**

    ```bash
    ollama pull llama3
    ```

4. **Run the bot:**

    **Note:**  
    In some LangGraph versions, the CLI command `langgraph dev` may not be installed due to packaging issues.  
    If so, simply run the project with:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

    In the console, type:

    ```
    You: What time is it?
    Bot: Current UTC time is: 2025-05-27T19:37:35.834012Z
    ```

    The agent will call the tool and display the current time.

    If you have the CLI:

    ```bash
    langgraph dev
    ```
